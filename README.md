## 🦀 Kanidm Provisioning Tool

This is a tiny helper utility that uses kanidm's API to provision
users, groups and oauth2 systems. This tool is needed to allow declarative
provisioning of kanidm in NixOS, but can be used on any other system as well.
This tool is not affiliated with kanidm itself. Use at your own discretion.

Two optional patches are provided for kanidm that allow you to:
- provision oauth2 basic secrets
- use a specific password when recovering admin account credentials.

Currently this tool supports the following provisioning operations which should suffice for basic SSO and OIDC needs.
PRs are of course welcome!

| | Provisioning Feature
---|---
| |
| 👪 | **Groups**
| ✅ | Create/delete
| ✅ | Members
| ❌ | Unix attributes
| |
| 🧑 | **Persons**
| ✅ | Create/delete
| ✅ | Attributes (displayname, legalname, mail)
| ❌ | Credentials
| ❌ | SSH
| ❌ | Unix attributes
| ❌ | Radius
| |
| 🌐 | **Oauth2**
| ✅ | Create/delete (basic, public)
| ✅ | Attributes (origin url, origin landing, pkce enable, prefer short username)
| ✅* | Basic secret
| ✅ | Scope maps
| ✅ | Supplementary scope maps
| ✅ | Claim maps

(*): Requires patch, [see below](#provisioning-oauth2-basic-secrets).

## Usage

Build the utility simply by running:

```bash
> cargo build
```

Afterwards you can apply a state file to your kanidm instance by executing:

```bash
KANIDM_PROVISION_IDM_ADMIN_TOKEN="your-idm-admin-token" \
  kanidm-provision --url 'https://auth.example.com' --state state.json
```

## Orphan removal

This tool automatically adds all created entities to a tracking group so
whenever something is removed from the state file in the future, the change
can be reflected in kanidm automatically.

To prevent this kind of orphan removal, you can to pass `--no-auto-remove`.
Removing for example a group from the state file will then not cause any
changes in kanidm, unless the state file explicitly specifies `present: false`.

This automatic tracking does not work for oauth2 claim maps, since claim maps
are not a separate entity in kanidm. To work around that, each oauth2 resource server
has a `removeOrphanedClaimMaps` option that will delete any claim maps on the resource
server that haven't been created by this tool. `--no-auto-remove` has no effect on that option.

## Provisioning oauth2 basic secrets

This tool is able to provision basic secrets if you build kanidm
with the patch provided in [./patches](./patches). This adds a new endpoint
that allows modifying the basic secret of any oauth2 resource server via a new API endpoint,
instead of only allowing to read the value generated by kanidm.

Some applications may have issues with certain characters appearing in the basic secret, especially with `&` which
causes issues when the application does not properly urlencode the secret. While this is a bug
in the application, you can prevent this from happening by generating new secret values with alphanumeric content:
```
tr --complement --delete 'ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghjkpqrstuvwxyz0123456789' < /dev/urandom | head --bytes 48
```

> \[!CAUTION\]
> If you use a patchset for kanidm 1.5 or older, you need to reset your kanidm
> database after applying these patches to the kanidm source code. Otherwise,
> the access control profile will not be updated and any call to the new
> endpoint will fail! The new patchset will automatically ensure these
> permissions are set on startup.

## Provisioning (idm_)admin credentials

The second provided patch is a standalone kanidm patch that adds the ability to
specify a password when recovering account credentials. Useful to provision the
idm_admin password and avoid dynamic state that needs to be known to run the
provisioning tool.

```bash
KANIDM_RECOVER_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD_FILE=<(echo V3kACDdwPjYUgYuLdlRfBqeBWf3TyJmv9h0f6CP3E3dv2B4S) \
  kanidmd recover-account idm_admin --from-environment >/dev/null
```

## JSON Schema

This is the schema consumed by this application.

Note that all keys for `groups`, `persons` and `systems.oauth2` need to be in lowercase.
E.g. `person1` is allowed, `Person1` or `pErSoN1` are not.

```yaml
